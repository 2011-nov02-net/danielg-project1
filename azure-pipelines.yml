# this file defines a pipeline, a set of rules for building and validating source code in a repo
# written in a format called YAML 

# trigger defines when the pipeline will run
# list of branches syntax, if a branch gets a push, the pipeline will run

trigger:
  branches:
   include:
     - master
  paths: 
   include:
     - danielg-projectOne
    
# short for agent pool as in "build agent"
# i.e. what set of machines will be the build agents to run these steps
pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

# variables common to multiple steps
variables:
  buildConfiguration: 'Release'

# these steps are run in sequence by the build agent
# in a directory that contains the most recent push on that branch of that repo
# if any step fails, that will halt the build and subsequent steps will not run
steps:
- script: dotnet build --configuration $(buildConfiguration)
  displayName: 'dotnet build $(buildConfiguration)'
